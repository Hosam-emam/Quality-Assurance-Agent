A small project for a Quality Assurance Agent. This system is designed to ensure the quality and reliability of software projects by automating various quality assurance tasks. It provides tools and agents to monitor, analyze, and improve the overall quality of the codebase and processes.

**System Overview**

The Quality Assurance Agent system is responsible for:

1. **Automated Code Analysis**:
   - Scans the codebase for potential issues, such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
   - Ensures adherence to coding standards and best practices.

2. **Testing Automation**:
   - Executes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
   - Provides detailed reports on test coverage and failures.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Captures logs from various components to track system behavior.
   - Monitors performance metrics and identifies bottlenecks.

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Manages application settings and ensures consistency across environments.
   - Provides tools to validate and update configurations.

5. **Reporting and Insights**:
   - Generates reports on code quality, test results, and system performance.
   - Offers actionable insights to improve the development process.
